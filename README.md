# Enhanced HTML Form Assignment 📝

## About this project
Hi! 👋 This is my HTML assignment where I tried to make a **fun and interactive webpage**.  
It includes **lists, tables, media, and a registration form**. I wanted to practice different HTML elements and learn how they work together on a page.

## What the page includes
- **Lists**: I made a list of things I like.  
- **Table**: Shows my weekly schedule.  
- **Media**: I added a placeholder image and a sample video.  
- **Form**: A registration form with fields like:
  - Full Name
  - Email
  - Phone Number
  - Date of Birth
  - Gender
  - Username (readonly)
  - Password
  - About You (textarea)
  - Terms and Conditions checkbox  

The form uses some basic validation like `required`, `pattern`, and `minlength` to make it a bit more interactive.

## How to view it
1. Make sure you have a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).  
2. Clone or download this repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lynn004/Enhanced-form-Assignment.git
